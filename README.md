- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Evan Wright
- I am currently studying Computer Science at UTD as a Senior with plans to pursue a Master's Degree
- I'm interested in various fields relating to CS, at the moment I'm curious about Cyber Security opportunities
- I'm actively pursuing internships for the coming summer and have a desire to continue my industry experience
Hope you enjoy some of my projects and my work, please reach out if there's anything you're interested about that I'm involved in!
