- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Evan Wright
- I am currently studying Computer Science at UTD as a Senior with plans to pursue a Master's Degree
- I'm interested in various fields relating to CS, at the moment I'm curious about Cyber Security opportunities

I've uploaded various projects and assignments from my time in school to demonstrate my skills, as well as various
personal projects, hope you enjoy some of my projects and my work
